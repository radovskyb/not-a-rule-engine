# not-a-rule-engine

## What am I building?

I'm not exactly sure yet, but it's definitely not a rule-engine, and I should probably try to work out what I'm actually trying to build before I continue.

## What's the goal?

Just felt like writing some good old fashioned code without any AI or tools, like we all used to do.

That in itself isn't a challenge for people like myself who predominantly don't use AI tools, so I am having fun trying to stricly see how far I can go without using any external dependencies outside of the Go std lib.

## Why now?

Sh\*ts and g\*ggles, why not.
